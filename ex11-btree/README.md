# Exercise 11 - B-Tree
## Problem description
Write a program that creates a B-Tree from integers ranged [0, 9999].
The program reads numbers from the standard input and checks for their
existence within the tree. If the number is not in the tree, it's inserted
and deleted otherwise.

##Technical requirements
The program should contain the following methods/procedures:
* INSERT
* DELETE

After each operation a visualisation of the tree should be displayed.

The B-Tree is of order 3 (6 keys per node).
